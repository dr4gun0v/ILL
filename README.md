### What is ILL?
**ILL** is a projected that I developed to learn C, I got some inspiration from LSE (Linux Exploit Suggester) and tried to create something simular to it but, I still recommend you to use [LSE](https://github.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester). ILL, is a simple project to search for kernel already-know vulnerabilities.
